Determine if a follow-up question should be asked based on the student's answer quality.

Question: {question_text}
Student Answer: {student_answer}
Grade: {grade}
Feedback: {feedback}

A follow-up question should be asked if:
- The answer demonstrates significant gaps in understanding (grade below 70)
- The answer lacks depth or detail
- There are clear misconceptions that need clarification
- The student would benefit from demonstrating improved understanding

If a follow-up question is warranted, generate a clarifying or probing question that:
- Addresses the specific gaps or misconceptions identified
- Helps assess whether the student can build on the previous answer
- Is appropriately challenging but fair

Respond in JSON format (no markdown formatting, just raw JSON):
{{
    "should_ask": <true or false>,
    "question_text": "The follow-up question text (if should_ask is true, otherwise null)",
    "context": "Additional context for the follow-up question (if should_ask is true, otherwise null)"
}}

If should_ask is false, set question_text and context to null.
