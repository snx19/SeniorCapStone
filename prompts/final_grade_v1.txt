Calculate the final exam grade based on the student's performance across all questions.

Question Scores: {question_scores}

Feedback Summary: {feedback_summary}

Please analyze the student's overall performance and provide:
1. A final grade (0-100) that reflects their overall performance
2. A comprehensive explanation summarizing their strengths and areas for improvement
3. The list of individual question scores for transparency

Consider:
- Overall consistency across questions
- Areas of strength demonstrated
- Patterns in weaknesses or gaps
- Overall mastery of the subject matter

The final grade should be a weighted average or adjusted based on performance patterns, but should fairly represent the student's overall understanding.

Respond in JSON format (no markdown formatting, just raw JSON):

    "explanation": "Comprehensive explanation of the final grade, including overall performance summary, key strengths, and areas for improvement",
    "question_scores": [<list of individual question scores as numbers>]
